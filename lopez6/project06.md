# Assignment 6 Write Up
This program allows a staff member from the Central Terminal to manage the station.
The staff member keeps track of the Transports (objects of the Transports class)
in a deque data type.

# Assignment 5 Algorithm
1. First, we create the Terminal class, 
our double ended queue data type.
2. We define the methods that allow us to add to the queue
from either direction.
3. Then we prompt the staff member.
4. The staff member should have the ability to add transports 
to the queue from the east (right) or west (left).
5. The staff member should have the ability to see the
transports currently at the Central Terminal.
6. The staff member should have the ability to quit the 
program.
