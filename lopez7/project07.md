# Assignment 7 Write Up
Because bubble sort needs to iterate through the list multiple times to sort, it doesn't scale well.
Merge sort, on the other hand, keeps on dividing itself in half until the numbers are sorted. 
Because merge sort doesn't need to iterate through the entire list, it performs well and scales great.

# Assignment 7 Algorithm
1. Select any two algorithms.
2. Create a list, or various lists of different sizes.
3. Shuffle the items in these lists.
4. Pass the shuffled lists into different sorting algorithms.
5. We use a timer to capture the time we started the sorting function.
6. Then we use another timer to capture the time we ended.
7. We subtract the start time from the end time to get the overall time it took.
8. We can then print these times for different algorithms to compare.
