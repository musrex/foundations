Because merge sort doesn't need to iterate through the entire list, performs well and scales great.

# Assignment 5 Algorithm
1. First, we create the Terminal class, 
our double ended queue data type.
2. We define the methods that allow us to add to the deque

3. Then we prompt the staff member.
4. The staff member should have the ability to add transports 
to the queue from the east (right) or west (left).
5. The staff member should have the ability to see the
transports currently at the Central Terminal.
6. The staff member should have the ability to quit the
