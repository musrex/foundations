# Assignment 5 Write Up
This program creates a Student class, and takes in NAME and AGE as attributes. The program then creates the Doctor and Engineer subclass, with Doctor taking the HOSPITAL attribute, and Engineer taking the COURSE attribute. Both Doctor and Engineer inherit the NAME and AGE attributes from the Student parent class, and each class has it's own display() method that returns the appropriate information.

# Assignment 5 Algorithm
1. First we create the Student class and specify the necessary attributes.
2. Then we create the Doctor and Engineer subclass.
3. We inherit the appropriate attributes from the Student parent class, and 
assign new attributes for each respective subclass.
