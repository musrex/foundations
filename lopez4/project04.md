# Assignment 4 Write Up
This program creates the rectangle class, providing us with a way to create rectangular objects and the methods necessary to return their dimensions. The program also creates a parallelepiped subclass, and the methods necessary to return the dimensions of an object in the parallelepiped subclass.

# Assignment 4 Algorithm
1. First, we create the Rectangle class.
2. We then create methods for this class - an area() and perimeter() method to return the afformentioned calculations, and then a display() method to print the dimensions of the object in the class Rectangle.
3. Next, we create a Parallelepiped class.
4. We then create methods for this class - a volume() methond to return the afformentioned calculations, and a display() method to print the dimensions of the object in the class Parallelepiped.
5. Lastly, to make sure everything is working, we create these objects and print them to the terminal.
