# Final project
This project is a banking app. The app allows our users to create an account, as well as 
perform the actions necessary to normal banking activities, like depositing
and withdrawing money, and even adding change.

# Final project algorithm
1. First, we establish our list of menu items.
2. This list of menu items gives us a blueprint for what our program needs to do
3. Based of the menue items, create the appropriate classes that allow us to create
the abstract data types necessary to run our bank.
4. These classes should include, but are not limited to:  
- an account class for managing the actual account
- a bank class for managing the operations of the bank
- a main BankManager class that pulls various actions together
